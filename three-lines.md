My name is Aidan Gowland and I’m an MA student in the Geographic Indigenous Futures Lab at the University of Victoria. My research focuses on Indigenous access to public spaces and how reduced access to, and jurisdiction over, these lands affects Canada’s compliance with national and international laws and normative frameworks regarding Indigenous rights and sovereignty.
